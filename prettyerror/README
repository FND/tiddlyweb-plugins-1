A plugin for TiddlyWeb that provides prettier error messages
than the plain text straight exceptions provided by the 
TiddlyWeb core.

The content is provided by tiddlers containing templated HTML.

The tiddlers are provided via a recipe called errors made up of
two bags. One contains the default error pages, the other is
initially empty such that the ADMIN of the instance can do what
they like.
