A plugin that adds an S5 serializer to TiddlyWeb, for
use when viewing a list of tiddlers. See the docstring
for more details.

See http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/ for more on S5.

Issues:

* WikiLinks in the rendered HTML will not be correct.
  This is the result of laziness at this time.
* Incremental exposure of slides has not yet been explored.
