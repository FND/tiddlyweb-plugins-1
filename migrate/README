migrate is a plugin for migrating the content of one
TiddlyWeb store to another. This can provide two functions:

* Duplicating a store to the same format for use elsehwere,
  or backups.
* changing the format of the store from one StorageInterface
  implementation to another (e.g. from text to sql).

To use 'migrate' the tiddlywebconfig.py in the source
instance should be edited to add 'migrate' to
'twanager_plugins' and to add a 'target_store' key.

The 'target_store' key's value is the same form as
'server_store', with the config information of the 
store being migrated to.

Here's an example that will migrate from the sql store
to the text store, with the data stored in a dir in
/tmp:

config = {
    'twanager_plugins': ['migrate'],
    'server_store': ['sql', {'db_config': 'sqlite:///test.db'}],
    'target_store': ['text', {'store_root': '/tmp/backupstore'}],
}

When tiddlers are migrated from one store to another, they
are stored as new revisions, so if the target store already
has a tiddler of the same name in the same bag, it will create
a new one, extending the revisions.
