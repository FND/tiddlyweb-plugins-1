A TiddlyWeb plugin which adds a _hash field to a tiddler in two ways.

* When a tiddler is put to the store one or more of its attributes is
  digested to a hash which is then saved with the tiddler.

* When a tiddler is get from the store, if there is no _hash, then the
  hash is added to the outgoing tiddler. It is _not_ saved

This is done to allow quick comparisons between tiddlers which may have
different names but may have the same set of content characteristics.

By default the attribute from which the digest is created is 'text'.
