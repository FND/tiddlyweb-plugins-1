methodhack provides a way to hand PUT and DELETE
requests that have been tunneled over POST for those
browsers that do not support PUT and DELETE. It handles
clients that support a protocol defined in the docs.

See the docstring in the plugin for more informatin.

N.B.: When using this with TiddlyWebWiki, a client-side
component is required as well. To this end, the following
jQuery plugin can be used as a TiddlyWiki plugin:
