mappingsql is TiddlyWeb StorageInterface implementation
that stubs out some ideas for mapping any arbitrary 
RDBMS table to a tiddler.

It has many limitations (on purpose):

* It is READ ONLY
* It only supports one bag.
* It has no support for recipes.
* It has no support revisions.
* It has no support for search.

You tell tiddlywebconfig.py what database you want to look
at, what table you want to map, and what bag name you want
that table to think of itself as. The column name 'id'[1]
is mapped to tiddler.title. Any column names that map to 
Tiddler attributes are applied. Otherwise, columns are
mapped into tiddler.fields.

TODO:

* Map title columns correctly.
* Make mapping of columns to tiddler attributes optional.
* Cast column data to unicode with flair.

column to tiddler.title.
