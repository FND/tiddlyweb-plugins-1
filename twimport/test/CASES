A brainstorm of the test cases we need:

* recursively parse a recipe to list of tiddler-like data structures
* parse a tiddlywiki to a list of tiddler-like data structures
* parse .tiddlers, .tid and .js files

* distinguish between importing into a bag and caching for instancer

* import a binary thing into a bag?
* import a tarball or zipfile into a bag binariwise?

What assumptions can we make about how we handle data?

Let's assume upfront that we are always using URLs (http, file,
otherwise).

So we need some sample data.

We need to validate in the face of unicode situations...
