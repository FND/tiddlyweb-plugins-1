The modules in this directory provide serialization modules to
do a very simple Atom format syndication of collections of tiddlers
(including one tiddler, and filtered tiddlers).

One serialization provides support for the Atom format, another
extends the existing HTML serialization to provide <link> elements
referring to the Atom feeds.

Atom formatted output can be had by requesting the application/atom+xml
format, or by appending a .atom to the end of a URL (before the query
porition) that returns one or more tiddlers.

To use this code add 'atomplugin' to system_plugins in your tiddlywebconfig.py:

config = {
    'system_plugins': ['atomplugin'],
}

And put atomplugin.py, atom.py and htmlatom.py in your TiddlyWeb instance
directory.

The Atom code is borrowed from Django's django/utils/feedgenerator.py
